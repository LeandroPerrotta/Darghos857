============================================


What is this?
	OTServ is a free MMORPG emulation, that creates a own gameworld server,
	based on the CIPSoft's Tibia.

How does it work?
	In the past OTServ could be played on Tibia 7.1, 7.11, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.61, 7.7, 7.71, 7.8 and then 7.81.
	OTServ is now played using Tibia 8.11.

	To connect Tibia client to OTServ you will have to use an IP changer, you can get one here 
	http://otfans.net/attachment.php?attachmentid=1149 or http://otfans.net/showthread.php?t=20767.

	Once that's done, start the OTServ up, quite simple, just execute otserv.exe by
	double clicking it. Then startup Tibia by double clicking its shortcut you made earlier,
	then go to Options and Network and tick off "Test Server Login". Then login with the
	following:
		Account Number: 111111
		Password: tibia
	And check it out. Once you are done, have a look around in the folders
	and take a look at the config. :)

	NEVER ever enter your real acc# and/or password when
	not connecting to the CIP servers.
	Then you are logged in.

	Whats New in 0.6.2?
Features?
	- Not much

How do I use this new stuff?
	I'm just going over what might not be familiar to you here.

	The word "actions" might be unfamiliar to you. What it is an action?
	For instance when you click on a door it will open, or drinking mana-fluids.
	"movement" is any thing you do when moving: stepping in or out a tile, adding
	or removing an item from/to somewhere, equipping or de-equipping an item, etc..
	"talkactions" are like actions, but they mean for talking. So, everytime you
	say something, it's a talkaction.

	There is other cool stuff such as SQL-support. It includes MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL and ODBC support.
	Google it if you don't know it, we won't explain other softwares here ;p

	Binary map, well this seems quite new doesn't it. For a long time maps have been in xml format
	and nowadays some maps are like 20 megabytes large which takes quite long to load. So you can now
	convert your xml map to a binary map format by a simple converter. This can be found at the OTfans.net Forums.

How do I compile OTServ?
	OTServ stores accounts, players and some other tabelar info within relational database. It is very reliable
	way which also provides huge possibilities of easy data management and manipulation. By default SQLite is
	selected as database engine. It doesn't require any configuration from you, OTServ is configured for it by default and all what you need is to provide SQLite library for it.
	
		Instructions to compile OTServ: http://otfans.net/wiki/index.php/Compiling_OTServ

MySQL Server
	By default OTServ uses SQLite database which doesn't require any configuration from you. However it is
	possible to use MySQL database instead of SQLite - MySQL is more powerful database system which is
	faster, more reliable and gives more possibilities. However MySQL is uses client-server structure which
	means you will need MySQL server for it.


		Instructions to setup a server:
			1. Download XAMPP (not XAMPP Lite) (http://www.apachefriends.org/download.php?xampp-win32-1.5.3a-installer.exe)
			2. Install
			3. Open "xampp-control.exe"
			4. Click on the buttons Start to open "MySQL" and "Apache"
			5. Go on your browser and type in the address bar "localhost" or "127.0.0.1"
			6. Find the name "phpmyadmin" and go to it
			7. You will find some controls, make a database called "otserv"
			8. Now you will be taken to the database, click the tab "SQL"
			9. Goto the file named sample.sql, its in the folder this README is in.
			10. Copy the text in that file and paste it in that text box on your browser then press ok ;)
			11. SQL instructions have been executed and a sample account (Account number: 111111, Password: tibia) and player should be made.
			12. Now go to your folder and open config.lua and make sure the SQL Stuff there is correct such as the mysql user and password ;).
				Should be all correct for you anyway ;).
			13. Start the server and login.

		Instructions to compile OTServ with MySQL:
			1. Download MySQL client libraries libraries from http://dev.mysql.com/ (or just install them from packages in your Linux distro).
			2. Compile your OTServ against MySQL:
				a) On Windows use -D__USE_MYSQL__ -lmysqlclient
				b) On POSIX systems use ./configure --enable-mysql

PostgreSQL Server
	PostgreSQL is, after MySQL, probably most popular open-source database system. It provides huge possibilities and
	better performance.

		Instructions to compile OTServ with PostgreSQL driver:
				a) On Windows use -D__USE_PGSQL__ -lpg
				b) On POSIX systems use ./configure --enable-pgsql

ODBC data sources
	OTServ contains also ODBC database driver. It allows to connect throught unified ODBC connection mechanism
	to any ODBC data source. It was first developed under Windows, but there are currently ODBC implementations
	on various platforms (search for UnixODBC).

	Note: under non-Windows OSes you will need to download UnixODBC. You most likely have it in your Linux
	ditro repositories as unixodbc and unixodbc-dev packages.

		Instructions to compile OTServ with ODBC driver:
				a) On Windows use -D__USE_ODBC__ -lodbc
				b) On POSIX systems use ./configure --enable-odbc

SQLite with other drivers
	By default any alternative driver like MySQL disables SQLite support. However sometimes you might want
	to compile more then one driver into your server (then you choose which one you want to use in your
	config.lua file).

		Instructions to compile OTServ with SQLite and other drivers:
			1. Download SQLite libraries from http://sqlite.org/download.html (or just install them from packages in your Linux distro).
			2. Compile your OTServ against SQLite:
				a) On Windows use -D__USE_SQLITE__ -lsqlite3 -D__USE_MYSQL__ -lmysqlclient
				b) On POSIX systems use ./configure --enable-mysql --enable-sqlite

What about old XML files?
	If you have your old database in XML format and want to switch to SQL database, there is XML2SQL project in our SVN tree.

Different Lua configuration file
	Default configuration file for OTServ is config.lua. In some cases you might need to use another name for 
	it as config.lua might be ambiguous. OTServ can use otserv.lua file instead of config.lua file.

		Instructions to compile OTServ to use otserv.lua config file:
			a) On Windows use -D__LUA_NAME_ALTER__
			b) On POSIX systems use ./configure --with-otconfig

KDE KDevelop compilation
	A graphical environment to program and compile otserv without any knowledge about the linux shell, it by 
	default will run the configuration without any flag, with that I mean that will be compiled with XML and 
	this can be easily changed opening the project and going to:
		1. Project -> Project Options
		2. Configure Options -> Configure arguents:
			By default debuging enabled, and it will say:
				--enable-debug=full
				If you don't like or want it, you can delete it.
		3. After (or replacing) --enable-debug=full you will write:
			a) for MySQL:
				--enable-mysql
			b) for ODBC:
				--enable-odbc
		4. Extra
			4.1 Different Lua configuration file
				--with-otconfig

Problems?
	The server is now stable nowadays, but if you do find bugs you can report them at the 
	OpenTibia Project Tools forum at OTFans(http://otfans.net/project.php?projectid=1). When the
	server crashes, you should get a report generated at your Otserv folder named report.txt, 
	you should also report this at the Project Tools forum, this report will help solving bugs a lot.
